The application will not handle the user's social media credentials directly. Instead, it will receive a one-time code from the social provider (web) or an ID token (mobile), which your backend exchanges for tokens.

Here's a breakdown of the flow and how to manage the different tokens:

## The Authentication Flow Step-by-Step 🔑

This process separates concerns: the social provider authenticates the user, and your application authorizes them and manages its own session.

### Web Authentication Flow

1.  **Initiate Login:** The user clicks a "Login with Google/GitHub/etc." button in your frontend application.

2.  **Redirect to Provider:** Your frontend redirects the user to the social provider's login page. This redirect URL includes your application's `client_id` and a `redirect_uri` (a URL in your app where the provider should send the user back).

3.  **User Consent:** The user logs into their social account (if they aren't already) and grants your application permission.

4.  **Provider Redirects Back with a Code:** The social provider redirects the user back to your specified `redirect_uri`. This URL will have a temporary `authorization_code` in its query parameters (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/callback?code=SOME_LONG_CODE`).

5.  **Code Exchange:** Your frontend sends this `authorization_code` to your backend. **Your backend is the only place that should handle secrets.**

6.  **Backend Gets Social Tokens:** Your backend securely sends the `authorization_code`, along with its `client_id` and `client_secret`, to the social provider's token endpoint. In return, it receives the social provider's `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

7.  **Fetch User Profile:** Using the newly obtained social `access_token`, your backend makes an API call to the provider's user info endpoint (e.g., Google's `/userinfo` endpoint) to get the user's details like their unique ID from that provider, email, name, etc.

8.  **Find or Create User in Your DB:**
    * Your backend checks if a user with this `provider_user_id` already exists in your database.
    * **If the user exists**, you've identified a returning user.
    * **If not**, you create a new user record in your `users` table. You generate your own **UUID** for this user and save their email and name. It's crucial to also save the unique ID from the social provider to link the accounts.

9.  **Generate *Your* SaaS Tokens:** Now that the user is identified or created in your system (with your UUID), your backend generates its **own** set of tokens using **RS256 asymmetric signing**:
    * An **Access Token** (JWT signed with RS256, short-lived, e.g., 15 minutes).
    * A **Refresh Token** (JWT signed with RS256, long-lived, e.g., 7 days).

10. **Secure Token Delivery:** Your backend implements secure token delivery using a dual approach:
    * **Refresh Token:** Stored in secure `HttpOnly` cookies (XSS-immune)
    * **Access Token:** **NOT sent in URL** - Backend redirects without tokens to prevent exposure
    * **Frontend Session Initialization:** Frontend calls `/auth/session` endpoint to exchange refresh token for access token

11. **Session Endpoint Exchange:** After OAuth redirect, the frontend calls the secure session endpoint:
    ```
    GET /v1/auth/session
    Cookie: refresh_token=...

    Response:
    {
      "accessToken": "eyJ...",
      "tokenType": "Bearer",
      "expiresIn": 900,
      "user": {...},
      "success": true
    }
    ```

12. **Dual Authentication Storage:**
    * **Refresh Token:** Remains in HttpOnly cookies (backend-managed)
    * **Access Token:** Stored in Redux state for API requests
    * **API Requests:** Use Bearer tokens from Redux + cookies for maximum compatibility

13. **Authenticated Session:** Your frontend now supports dual authentication:
    * **Cookie-based:** Automatic inclusion via `credentials: 'include'`
    * **Bearer token:** Authorization header from Redux state
    * **Hybrid approach:** Both methods work for different client types (web browsers vs API clients)

### Mobile Authentication Flow (Android & iOS)

Mobile applications use a different flow optimized for native apps, leveraging platform-specific OAuth SDKs.

1. **Initiate Native Login:** The user taps a "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Apple" button in your mobile app.

2. **Native OAuth SDK:** The mobile app uses the platform's native OAuth SDK:
   * **Android:** Google Sign-In SDK
   * **iOS:** Google Sign-In SDK or Sign in with Apple

3. **Native Authentication:** The SDK handles authentication through:
   * **System Account:** Uses existing device accounts (no password entry needed)
   * **WebView/Browser:** Falls back to web authentication if needed
   * **Biometric:** May use Face ID/Touch ID for Apple Sign In

4. **Receive ID Token:** After successful authentication, the SDK returns:
   * **ID Token:** A JWT containing user information, signed by the provider
   * **Access Token (optional):** For accessing provider APIs
   * **User Profile:** Basic user information (name, email, profile picture)

5. **Send to Mobile Endpoint:** The mobile app sends the ID token to your backend's mobile-specific endpoint:
   ```
   POST /auth/google/mobile
   {
     "id_token": "eyJhbGc...",
     "access_token": "ya29..." // optional
   }
   ```

6. **Backend Validates ID Token:** Your backend:
   * Validates the ID token signature using the provider's public keys
   * Verifies the token hasn't expired
   * Checks the audience (client ID) matches your app
   * Extracts user information from the validated token

7. **Device Tracking:** The backend captures mobile-specific information:
   * **Device ID:** Unique identifier for the device
   * **Device Type:** mobile/tablet
   * **Platform:** iOS/Android
   * **Device Fingerprint:** Generated from device characteristics
   * **App Version:** For compatibility tracking

8. **Find or Create User:** Same as web flow - check if user exists, create if new.

9. **Generate Enhanced JWT:** Create JWT tokens with mobile-specific claims:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "user-uuid",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "did": "device-id",
     "deviceType": "mobile",
     "platform": "ios",
     "fp": "fingerprint-hash"
   }
   ```

10. **Return Tokens to App:** Send tokens back to mobile app:
    * **Access Token:** Short-lived JWT signed with RS256
    * **Refresh Token:** Long-lived JWT signed with RS256, tied to device
    * **User Profile:** Current user information

11. **Secure Token Storage:** Mobile app stores tokens securely:
    * **iOS:** Keychain Services
    * **Android:** Android Keystore or Encrypted SharedPreferences
    * Never store in plain text files or unencrypted databases

12. **Authenticated Requests:** Mobile app includes access token in API requests:
    * Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
    * Device ID: `X-Device-ID: <device_id>`

## Secure Token Delivery Endpoint 🔐

The Orkestra system implements a dedicated endpoint for secure token delivery after OAuth authentication, eliminating security vulnerabilities associated with URL-based token transmission.

### `/auth/session` Endpoint

**Purpose:** Exchange refresh token from HttpOnly cookie for fresh access token

**Method:** `GET /v1/auth/session`

**Authentication:** Requires valid refresh token in HttpOnly cookie

**Security Features:**
- **No URL tokens:** Eliminates token exposure in browser history and server logs
- **Cookie-based authentication:** Uses secure refresh token from HttpOnly cookie
- **Fresh token generation:** Provides new access token with updated expiry
- **Risk assessment:** Includes security validation and device tracking

### Request/Response Flow

**Request:**
```http
GET /v1/auth/session HTTP/1.1
Host: your-backend.com
Cookie: orkestra_refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "user": {
    "id": "user-uuid-here",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "john_doe",
    "fullName": "John Doe",
    "role": "manager",
    "isActive": true,
    "emailVerified": true,
    "lastLogin": "2025-09-28T10:15:30Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T08:30:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-09-28T10:15:30Z"
  },
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// No refresh token in cookie
{
  "status": 401,
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "detail": "No refresh token found in cookie"
}

// Invalid or expired refresh token
{
  "status": 401,
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "detail": "Invalid refresh token"
}
```

### Frontend Integration

**React/Redux Implementation:**
```typescript
// Call session endpoint after OAuth callback
const sessionResult = await useLazyGetSessionQuery();

if (sessionResult.data) {
  // Store access token in Redux state
  dispatch(setAccessToken({
    accessToken: sessionResult.data.accessToken,
    expiresIn: sessionResult.data.expiresIn
  }));

  // Update user info in Redux
  dispatch(setUserFromApiResponse(sessionResult.data.user));
}
```

**API Client Usage:**
```typescript
// API client automatically uses tokens from Redux
const baseQuery = fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: '/v1',
  credentials: 'include', // Include cookies
  prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
    // Add Bearer token from Redux if available
    const accessToken = selectAccessToken(getState());
    if (accessToken && !isTokenExpired(accessToken)) {
      headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`);
    }
    return headers;
  },
});
```

### Security Benefits

1. **URL Protection:** No sensitive data in browser URLs or history
2. **Server Log Safety:** Tokens never appear in access logs
3. **Referrer Protection:** No token leakage via HTTP referrer headers
4. **XSS Resistance:** Refresh tokens remain in HttpOnly cookies
5. **Controlled Exchange:** Backend validates and generates fresh tokens on demand

### OAuth Callback Security

**Before (Insecure):**
```
https://frontend.com/auth/callback?success=true&access_token=eyJ...&expires_in=3600
```

**After (Secure):**
```
https://frontend.com/auth/callback?success=true&user_id=uuid&email=user@example.com&provider=google
```

The new flow completely eliminates token exposure while maintaining full functionality through the secure session endpoint.

## Managing the Two Types of Tokens

This is the most important part. You are dealing with two separate sets of tokens with different purposes.

### 1. Your SaaS Tokens (Access & Refresh)

These are the tokens *you* create to manage user sessions within your own application.

* **SaaS Access Token (JWT):**
    * **Purpose:** To authorize API requests to *your* backend.
    * **Algorithm:** RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) - **Asymmetric signing for enhanced security**
    * **Payload:** Should contain your internal user `UUID` (e.g., in the `sub` claim), an expiration date (`exp`), and any other relevant session data.
    * **Lifecycle:** Short-lived (15 minutes). When it expires, frontend can refresh it using the `/auth/session` endpoint.
    * **Storage:**
      - **WEB:** Redux state (obtained via `/auth/session` endpoint)
      - **MOBILE:** Platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore)
    * **Security:** Signed with private key, verifiable with public key, short expiry minimizes exposure
    * **Delivery:** Never sent in URLs - obtained through secure endpoint exchange

* **SaaS Refresh Token (JWT):**
    * **Purpose:** To get a new SaaS access token when the old one expires.
    * **Algorithm:** RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) - **Same asymmetric signing as access tokens**
    * **Storage:** Store it securely in your database, associated with the user and device.
    * **Web:** **HttpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies EXCLUSIVELY** - No client-side JavaScript access
    * **Mobile:** Platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore)
    * **Lifecycle:** Long-lived (7 days).
    * **Mobile Features:** Device-bound, supports multiple devices per user
    * **Security:** Cannot be forged without access to the private key, immune to XSS attacks

### 2. Social Provider Tokens (Access & Refresh)

These are the tokens you receive from Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.

* **Purpose:** To access the social provider's API *on behalf of the user*.
* **Do you need to save them?** Yes, if:
    * You need to perform actions later.
    * If your app needs to, for example, read a user's Google Calendar events or post to their GitHub repository in the future, then **you must securely save the social refresh token** in your database (always encrypt it at rest).
* **Mobile Specifics:**
    * Mobile apps often only receive ID tokens, not refresh tokens
    * ID tokens are one-time use for authentication only
    * If ongoing access needed, must request additional scopes

**In summary:** unless your SaaS needs ongoing access to the user's social media account, **do not store the social provider's tokens.**

---

## Mobile-Specific Security Features

### Device Management

Mobile authentication includes comprehensive device tracking and management:

* **Device Registration:** Each device gets a unique ID on first login
* **Device Naming:** Users can name their devices (e.g., "John's iPhone")
* **Multiple Devices:** Support for multiple devices per user account
* **Device Revocation:** Users can revoke access to specific devices
* **Session Listing:** View all active sessions with device details

### Enhanced Security

* **Device Fingerprinting:** Generate unique fingerprints based on:
  * Device model and OS version
  * App version and build number
  * Screen resolution and hardware IDs

* **Risk-Based Authentication:**
  * Location tracking (with user permission)
  * Unusual device detection
  * New location alerts
  * Risk scoring for each login attempt

* **Platform Security:**
  * **iOS:** Keychain access with biometric protection
  * **Android:** Hardware-backed key storage when available
  * Encrypted local storage for sensitive data

* **Offline Support:**
  * Cached user data for offline access
  * Queue API requests when offline
  * Sync when connection restored
  * Token refresh queuing

### Token Refresh Flow for Mobile

Mobile apps handle token refresh differently due to background execution limits:

1. **Proactive Refresh:** Refresh tokens when app returns to foreground
2. **Background Refresh:** Use platform background tasks (limited)
3. **On-Demand Refresh:** Refresh on 401 response automatically
4. **Refresh Token Rotation:** New refresh token with each refresh
5. **Device Binding:** Refresh tokens tied to device ID

## JWT Security Implementation 🔐

The Orkestra system implements industry-standard JWT security using RS256 asymmetric signing to ensure token integrity and prevent forgery.

### RS256 Algorithm Benefits

**Why RS256 over HS256:**
- **Asymmetric Security:** Uses public/private key pairs instead of shared secrets
- **Enhanced Security:** Private key used for signing, public key for verification
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Public key can be safely distributed without compromising security
- **Industry Standard:** Recommended by security experts and widely adopted
- **Future-Proof:** Supports key rotation and advanced security practices

### Key Management

**RSA Key Pair:**
- **Key Size:** 2048-bit RSA keys for strong security
- **Private Key:** Used exclusively by backend for token signing
- **Public Key:** Used by backend (and potentially frontend/mobile) for token verification
- **Storage:** Private key secured in `/app/keys/jwt-private.pem`, public key in `/app/keys/jwt-public.pem`
- **Permissions:** Private key readable only by application, public key can be shared

**Key Generation:**
```bash
# Generate new JWT keys (run from project root)
./scripts/generate-jwt-keys.sh
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# JWT Key Paths (mounted in Docker containers)
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/app/keys/jwt-private.pem
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/app/keys/jwt-public.pem
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=15m
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d
```

### Token Structure

**Enhanced JWT Claims:**
```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
{
  "sub": "user-uuid-here",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "manager",
  "type": "access",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567800,
  "iss": "orkestra",
  "aud": "orkestra-api",
  "sid": "session-id",
  "did": "device-id",
  "ip": "client-ip",
  "fp": "device-fingerprint",
  "risk": 0.1,
  "provider": "google",
  "scope": ["profile", "email", "api"],
  "caps": ["reports:view", "tasks:manage"],
  "perms": ["read", "update"]
}
```

### Security Verification

**Token Validation Process:**
1. **Signature Verification:** Token signature validated using public key
2. **Algorithm Check:** Ensures token uses RS256 (rejects HS256 and other algorithms)
3. **Expiration Check:** Verifies token hasn't expired
4. **Issuer Validation:** Confirms token issued by Orkestra system
5. **Type Validation:** Ensures access/refresh token type matches expected usage
6. **Claims Extraction:** Safely extracts user information and permissions

**Attack Prevention:**
- **Token Forgery:** Impossible without private key access
- **Algorithm Confusion:** Explicitly validates RS256 algorithm
- **Key Confusion:** Separate validation for different token types
- **Replay Attacks:** Short-lived tokens with unique session IDs
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Tokens verify authenticity via cryptographic signatures

### Breaking Changes from HS256

**Migration Impact:**
- **All existing tokens invalidated:** Users must re-authenticate after deployment
- **No backward compatibility:** HS256 tokens will be rejected
- **Enhanced security:** Asymmetric signing prevents secret-based attacks
- **Key management required:** Private/public key pair must be properly secured

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Generate secure RSA key pair before deployment
- Ensure private key is never committed to version control
- Plan for user re-authentication after upgrade
- Monitor logs for signature validation errors during transition

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 🛡️

The Orkestra system implements a 5-role hierarchy for managing user permissions across different system areas.

### Role Hierarchy

```
ceo (CEO - Full System Access)
├─ amministratore (Administrator - Business Operations)
├─ manager (Manager - Team Management)
├─ operatore (Operator - Field Operations)
└─ ospite (Guest - Limited Access)
```

**Role Definitions:**

* **`ceo`** - CEO with full system access
  * Complete system control and oversight
  * User management and role assignment
  * System configuration and settings
  * All administrative functions
  * Access to development and testing tools

* **`amministratore`** - Administrator for business operations management
  * Fleet management and vehicle oversight
  * User management (excluding CEO role assignment)
  * Task creation and assignment
  * Reporting and analytics access
  * Business configuration settings

* **`manager`** - Manager for team and operational management
  * Task assignment and oversight
  * Team performance monitoring
  * Operational reports and metrics
  * Resource allocation
  * Team member management

* **`operatore`** - Operator for field operations and task execution
  * Task execution and updates
  * Vehicle status reporting
  * Basic tracking and location updates
  * Mobile app primary role
  * Profile management

* **`ospite`** - Guest with limited read-only access
  * View-only access to basic information
  * Limited dashboard access
  * Cannot modify any data
  * Cannot access sensitive information

### Implementation

#### Protecting Routes with Roles

**Exact Role Matching** (use sparingly):
```go
// Only CEO users
router.Use(authMiddleware.RequireRole("ceo"))
```

**Hierarchical Role Access** (recommended):
```go
// manager role and above (manager, amministratore, ceo)
router.Use(authMiddleware.RequireHierarchicalRole("manager"))
```

#### Route Organization by Access Level

Organize your routes by logical access patterns:

```go
// Super admin only - User and system management
router.Route("/admin", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Use(authMiddleware.RequireHierarchicalRole("super_admin"))

    // User management endpoints
    r.Post("/users", createUser)
    r.Put("/users/{id}/role", updateUserRole)
    r.Delete("/users/{id}", deleteUser)

    // System settings
    r.Get("/settings", getSystemSettings)
    r.Put("/settings", updateSystemSettings)
})

// Administrator and above - Business operations
router.Route("/management", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Use(authMiddleware.RequireHierarchicalRole("administrator"))

    // Fleet management
    r.Get("/vehicles", getVehicles)
    r.Post("/vehicles", createVehicle)
    r.Put("/vehicles/{id}", updateVehicle)

    // Advanced reporting
    r.Get("/reports/analytics", getAnalytics)
    r.Get("/reports/performance", getPerformanceReports)
})

// Manager and above - Operational oversight
router.Route("/operations", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Use(authMiddleware.RequireHierarchicalRole("manager"))

    // Task management
    r.Get("/tasks", getTasks)
    r.Post("/tasks", createTask)
    r.Put("/tasks/{id}/assign", assignTask)

    // Team oversight
    r.Get("/teams/{id}/performance", getTeamPerformance)
    r.Get("/operators", getOperators)
})

// All authenticated users - Basic functionality
router.Route("/app", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Use(authMiddleware.RequireAuth)

    // Task execution (operators)
    r.Get("/tasks/assigned", getMyTasks)
    r.Put("/tasks/{id}/status", updateTaskStatus)

    // Profile management (all users)
    r.Get("/profile", getProfile)
    r.Put("/profile", updateProfile)
})
```

#### Checking Roles in Handlers

Extract and check user roles within handler functions:

```go
func someHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Get user role from context (set by auth middleware)
    userRole, exists := middleware.GetUserRole(r.Context())
    if !exists {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        return
    }

    // Check role permissions manually if needed
    canManageUsers := userRole == "super_admin"
    canViewReports := userRole == "super_admin" ||
                     userRole == "administrator" ||
                     userRole == "manager"

    // Or use the hierarchy helper
    if !middleware.DefaultRoleHierarchy.HasPermission(userRole, "manager") {
        http.Error(w, "Insufficient permissions", http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }

    // Handler logic continues...
}
```

#### Role Assignment

**Default Role Assignment:**
- New users are automatically assigned the `operator` role
- Super admins can promote users to higher roles

**Role Update API:**
```go
// PUT /admin/users/{id}/role (super_admin only)
type UpdateRoleRequest struct {
    Role string `json:"role" validate:"required,oneof=super_admin administrator manager operator"`
}
```

#### Frontend Role Handling

The frontend receives the user's role in the JWT token and authentication response:

```typescript
// Example JWT payload (RS256 signed)
{
  "alg": "RS256",           // Algorithm header
  "typ": "JWT"              // Token type header
}
{
  "sub": "user-uuid-here",  // User UUID (subject)
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "manager",
  "type": "access",         // Token type (access/refresh)
  "exp": 1234567890,        // Expiration timestamp
  "iat": 1234567800,        // Issued at timestamp
  "iss": "orkestra",             // Issuer
  "aud": "orkestra-api",         // Audience
  "sid": "session-id",      // Session ID
  "did": "device-id"        // Device ID
}

// Use role for UI conditional rendering
const canManageTeam = ['super_admin', 'administrator', 'manager'].includes(user.role);
const canAccessAdmin = user.role === 'super_admin';

// IMPORTANT: Frontend never directly accesses JWT tokens
// Note: Tokens are in HttpOnly cookies, inaccessible to JavaScript
// Frontend gets user data via /auth/me API endpoint
```

#### Security Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth**: Always validate roles on the backend, never trust frontend role checks alone

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum role needed for their functions

3. **Role Separation**: Keep role logic separate from business logic for maintainability

4. **Audit Logging**: Log role changes and sensitive operations for security auditing

5. **Token Validation**: Roles are embedded in JWT tokens and validated on every request

#### Error Handling

The system returns appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization failures:

- **401 Unauthorized**: No valid authentication token
- **403 Forbidden**: Valid token but insufficient role permissions

```json
{
  "status": 403,
  "title": "Insufficient permissions",
  "detail": "User role 'operator' does not have permission to access this resource",
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "insufficient permissions",
      "location": "require_hierarchical_role",
      "value": "manager_required"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Enhanced Security Architecture 🔒

**LATEST SECURITY UPDATE:** The Orkestra system has implemented a dual authentication architecture that combines maximum security with maximum flexibility.

### Security Evolution

**Previous Vulnerabilities Addressed:**
- Access tokens exposed in OAuth redirect URLs (browser history, server logs)
- localStorage token storage creating XSS attack vectors
- Inconsistent authentication patterns across different client types

**Current Security Implementation:**
- **Secure token delivery** via dedicated `/auth/session` endpoint
- **Dual authentication support:** HttpOnly cookies + Redux-managed Bearer tokens
- **Zero URL token exposure** - Tokens never appear in redirect URLs
- **XSS-resistant refresh tokens** - HttpOnly cookies inaccessible to JavaScript
- **Flexible client support** - Works with both browser and API clients

### Implementation Changes

**1. Dual Authentication API Client (`baseApi.ts`):**
```typescript
// SECURE: Hybrid authentication approach
const baseQuery = fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: `${import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL}/v1`,
  credentials: 'include', // HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens
  prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
    headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');

    // Add Bearer token from Redux if available and valid
    const state = getState() as RootState;
    const accessToken = state.auth?.accessToken;
    const tokenExpiry = state.auth?.tokenExpiry;

    if (accessToken && tokenExpiry && new Date(tokenExpiry) > new Date()) {
      headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`);
    }

    return headers;
  },
});
```

**2. Secure Token Acquisition:**
```typescript
// SECURE: Token obtained via secure endpoint, not URL
const sessionResult = await triggerGetSession();

if (sessionResult.data) {
  // Store access token in Redux (memory-based, not localStorage)
  dispatch(setAccessToken({
    accessToken: sessionResult.data.accessToken,
    expiresIn: sessionResult.data.expiresIn
  }));

  // Update user data
  dispatch(setUserFromApiResponse(sessionResult.data.user));
}
```

**3. Enhanced Redux State Security:**
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  // NEW: Secure access token management
  accessToken: string | null;     // Bearer token for API requests
  tokenExpiry: Date | null;       // Token expiration tracking
  // Refresh tokens remain in HttpOnly cookies (backend-managed)
}
```

#### Cookie Security Configuration

**Backend Cookie Settings:**
- **HttpOnly**: `true` - Prevents JavaScript access
- **Secure**: `true` - HTTPS only in production
- **SameSite**: `Strict` - CSRF protection
- **Path**: `/` - Application-wide access
- **MaxAge**: Configurable token lifetimes

### Migration Impact

**Breaking Changes:**
- **All localStorage token access removed** - Any code relying on `localStorage.getItem('access_token')` will fail
- **Bearer token authentication disabled** - All requests must use `credentials: 'include'`
- **Client-side token manipulation eliminated** - No programmatic token access

**User Experience:**
- **Seamless authentication** - Users experience no functional changes
- **Automatic session management** - Backend handles all token operations
- **Enhanced security** - Complete protection against XSS token theft

### Dual Authentication Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Refresh tokens protected in HttpOnly cookies (XSS-immune)
2. **API Flexibility**: Bearer tokens support for various client types
3. **Zero URL Exposure**: No tokens in browser history or server logs
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Cookie-based auth continues to work
5. **Mobile Support**: Unchanged mobile authentication flow
6. **Developer Experience**: Clear separation between refresh and access tokens

## Dual Authentication Pattern 🔄

The Orkestra system implements a sophisticated dual authentication pattern that provides both maximum security and maximum flexibility.

### Authentication Methods Supported

| Method | Use Case | Token Storage | Security Level |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **HttpOnly Cookies** | Web browsers, traditional apps | Server-managed cookies | 🟢 Highest (XSS-immune) |
| **Bearer Tokens** | API clients, mobile apps, SPAs | Redux state/Native storage | 🟡 High (short-lived) |
| **Hybrid Mode** | Modern web apps | Both methods | 🟢 Maximum (best of both) |

### Client Implementation Patterns

**Web Browser (Hybrid):**
```typescript
// Automatic dual authentication
fetch('/v1/protected', {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include',                    // Sends HttpOnly cookies
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` // Sends Bearer token
  }
});
```

**API Client (Bearer Only):**
```typescript
// Pure Bearer token authentication
fetch('/v1/protected', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

**Legacy Browser (Cookie Only):**
```typescript
// Traditional cookie-based authentication
fetch('/v1/protected', {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include'
});
```

### Backend Authentication Validation

The backend supports multiple authentication methods and validates them in order:

1. **Bearer Token Validation** (if present)
   - Extract token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - Validate RS256 signature and expiration
   - Extract user claims and permissions

2. **Cookie Token Validation** (fallback)
   - Extract refresh token from HttpOnly cookie
   - Validate token and user session
   - Generate temporary access for request

3. **Authentication Result**
   - User authenticated if either method succeeds
   - Request proceeds with user context
   - Failed authentication returns 401 Unauthorized

### Token Lifecycle Management

**Access Token (Bearer):**
- **Lifespan**: 15 minutes
- **Storage**: Redux state (web), Keychain/Keystore (mobile)
- **Refresh**: Via `/auth/session` endpoint using refresh token
- **Security**: Short-lived, minimizes exposure window

**Refresh Token (Cookie):**
- **Lifespan**: 7 days
- **Storage**: HttpOnly cookie (XSS-immune)
- **Rotation**: New token issued on each refresh
- **Security**: Long-lived but inaccessible to client-side JavaScript

### Migration Path

**Existing Applications:**
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - Cookie authentication continues to work
- ✅ **Gradual adoption** - Can implement Bearer tokens incrementally
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - Existing clients unaffected

**New Applications:**
- 🎯 **Start with hybrid** - Implement both methods for maximum flexibility
- 🎯 **Mobile-first** - Use Bearer tokens for mobile applications
- 🎯 **Progressive enhancement** - Add Bearer support to existing cookie-based apps

### Verification Methods

**Security Audit Commands:**
```bash
# Verify no URL token exposure in OAuth callbacks
grep -r "access_token.*redirect" backend/internal/auth/handlers/

# Verify dual authentication implementation
grep -r "Authorization.*Bearer" frontend/src/store/api/baseApi.ts
grep -r "credentials.*include" frontend/src/store/api/baseApi.ts

# Verify /auth/session endpoint exists
grep -r "/auth/session" backend/internal/auth/handlers/auth_handler.go

# Verify Redux token storage (not localStorage)
grep -r "accessToken.*Redux\|setAccessToken" frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Zero access_token parameters in OAuth redirect URLs
- ✅ Dual authentication in API client (Bearer + cookies)
- ✅ `/auth/session` endpoint properly implemented
- ✅ Access tokens managed in Redux state (not localStorage)
- ✅ Refresh tokens remain in HttpOnly cookies
