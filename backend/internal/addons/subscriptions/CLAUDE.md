# Module: Subscriptions

_Path: `/backend/internal/addons/subscriptions`_
_Parent: [../../../CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md)_

## Module home

This directory is a **separate Go module**
(`github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-addon-subscriptions`) since Phase 5f
of the SDK split. Source lives in-tree at this path for monorepo
development; the same tree is mirrored to
[github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-addon-subscriptions](https://github.com/orkestra-cc/orkestra-addon-subscriptions)
and tagged starting from `v0.1.0`. Backend's `go.mod` carries a
`replace` directive pointing at this path so changes here take effect
without a tag bump during cross-cutting work; CI and external
consumers fetch the published version through the Go module proxy.

`handlers/me_handler_test.go` previously imported
`backend/internal/testkit` for its `NewIdentity(...).ContextFor(...)`
helper. Phase 5f replaced that call site with an inline `authedCtx`
that stamps the SDK `ctxauth.Key*` constants directly — the
production handlers in this package don't read `JWTClaims` from
context, so the slimmer helper is sufficient. `internal/testkit`
stays in the backend module for now; it still serves the payments
and compliance addons, which will get the same treatment as part of
their own extractions.

Recurring-revenue core: a catalog of AI services the operator sells and subscriptions binding Tier-2 external tenants to those services with cycle-based billing and an append-only activity log.

## Responsibility split

- **Subscriptions owns**: what's for sale, which tenant bought it, when the next charge is due, and an audit trail. No gateway code.
- **Payments owns**: Stripe (and later PayPal) API calls + webhook verification. Subscriptions consumes it through `iface.PaymentProvider`.
- **Billing (FatturaPA)** is NOT involved in v1 — subscription invoices are internal receipts (number format `SUB-YYYY-NNNNNN`), separate from fiscal compliance. Future integration with `billing` for Italian B2B clients is deferred.

## Cycle-free wiring with `payments`

Neither module declares the other in `Dependencies()`. `subscriptions` resolves `iface.PaymentProvider` lazily from `ServiceRegistry` on every charge (see `services/renewal_service.go:paymentProvider`). `payments` does the same for `iface.SubscriptionReconciler`. Because both registrations complete during `Init()` and lookups happen during `Start()` / HTTP / ticker, there is no init-time ordering constraint.

If `payments` is disabled, the renewal job still generates invoices but marks them `awaiting_manual_payment` and emits `manual_payment_required` activity — the workflow keeps running so manual bank transfers can be reconciled by editing the invoice status.

## State machine (`models.SubStatus`)

```
active ──charge_failed──▶ past_due ──retry_succeeded──▶ active
                              │
                              └──max_failures (3)──▶ suspended
active | past_due | suspended ──admin_cancel──▶ cancelled (terminal)
active ──cancel_at_period_end─▶ (ends at CurrentPeriodEnd)─▶ cancelled
```

Transitions happen in `services/subscription_service.go` (user actions) and `services/renewal_service.go` (charge outcomes). The reconciler (webhook path) transitions on async events and **is idempotent** — receiving the same Stripe event twice is a no-op.

## Renewal job

`jobs/renewal_job.go` tickles every `SUBSCRIPTIONS_RENEWAL_INTERVAL` (default 1h). Each tick: find subscriptions with `NextBillingAt <= now` AND `status ∈ {active, past_due}`, generate an invoice, attempt a charge, update state. Failed charges push `NextBillingAt` out by 1 day so we retry tomorrow, not every tick.

## Tenant scope (Unified Client Aggregate)

Every subscription is owned by a single `Tenant` aggregate (`Subscription.TenantUUID`). Self-registered clients ride on a personal tenant materialized lazily by `TenantProvider.EnsureTenantForUser`; admin-attached business clients ride on the business tenant.

`SubscriptionService.Create(ctx, tenantUUID, serviceUUID, tierCode, actor)` is the operator-admin entry point; `CreateForTenant(ctx, tenantUUID, serviceCode, tierCode, actor)` is the self-service variant that resolves the service by its human-typed SKU code.

Operator-admin routes (service catalog, subscription admin, invoice/activity reads) sit behind `RequireInternalTenant()`. The self-service `POST /v1/me/subscriptions` defaults the scope to the caller's personal tenant; pass `tenantUuid` to subscribe under a tenant the caller owns (handler enforces ownership via `TenantProvider.ListUserMemberships`).

A thin `TenantSubscriptionAdapter` (`services/tenant_provider.go`) implements `iface.TenantSubscriptionProvider` so `core/tenant` can serve `GET /v1/admin/tenants/{id}/subscriptions` — the adapter filters by `tenantUUID`.

**Renewals:** `RenewalService.loadTenant` calls `TenantProvider.GetTenant(sub.TenantUUID)` for billing identity (LegalName, VAT, country, email, StripeCustomerID); the Stripe-customer-id write goes through `TenantProvider.SetTenantStripeCustomerID`. No per-owner-kind branching — the personal tenant aggregate carries everything the renewal flow needs.

## Collections

| Collection | Notes |
|---|---|
| `subscriptions_services` | Catalog items with pricing tiers. `code` is unique. |
| `subscriptions_subscriptions` | Cycle state. `(tenantUUID, status)` for tenant-scoped reads, `(nextBillingAt, status)` for the renewal scan, `serviceUUID` for catalog joins. |
| `subscriptions_invoices` | Generated per cycle. `(subscriptionUUID, periodStart)` unique prevents double-billing the same cycle. Carries `tenantUUID` denormalized from the parent subscription for cross-tenant listings. |
| `subscriptions_activity` | Append-only audit log. `(subscriptionUUID, createdAt desc)` indexed for the detail-page timeline. |

## Tier-2 self-service routes (ADR-0003 client surface)

Mounted on `ri.Client.ProtectedRouter` behind `RequireGlobal()` via `RegisterSelfServiceRoutes`. Each handler builds a "caller tenant set" from `TenantProvider.EnsureTenantForUser` (the personal tenant) plus every owned tenant from `ListUserMemberships`; reads fan out across that set, mutations target one subscription at a time.

```
POST /v1/me/subscriptions                          { tenantUuid?, serviceCode, tierCode }
GET  /v1/me/subscriptions                          ?tenantUuid&status
GET  /v1/me/subscriptions/{id}
POST /v1/me/subscriptions/{id}/cancel              { atPeriodEnd }
POST /v1/me/subscriptions/{id}/reactivate
GET  /v1/me/subscriptions/{id}/invoices
GET  /v1/me/subscriptions/{id}/activity
```

`POST /v1/me/subscriptions` defaults the scope to the caller's personal tenant; pass `tenantUuid` to subscribe under a tenant the caller owns.

The module also publishes `iface.SelfServiceCheckoutPlanner` under `module.ServiceSelfServiceCheckoutPlanner`. Implementation in `services/checkout_planner.go` resolves a subscription UUID into the snapshot the payments client handler needs to open a Stripe Checkout session (`Owner` + pending invoice + tier price). Returns `iface.ErrCheckoutNoPendingInvoice` when nothing is due — the payments handler maps that to 409.

## Not in v1

Trials, proration, metered usage, multi-currency, FatturaPA issuance, dunning sequences beyond one failure email, org-scoped RBAC. Member invites + per-tenant role assignment also deferred — Tier-2 routes assume single-owner tenants.
