# Module: Navigation — Dynamic menu aggregator

_Path: `/backend/internal/core/navigation`_
_Parent: [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)_

[← Core](../CLAUDE.md) | [☰ Backend](../../../CLAUDE.md) | [Root](../../../../CLAUDE.md)

## Purpose

Collects `NavItems()` from every registered module at boot, filters the result by the caller's system role and the current module enable/disable state, and returns a single JSON tree to the frontend. One endpoint, one responsibility: the frontend sidebar is backend-driven, so adding a menu entry means editing the owning module's `NavItems()`, not the frontend.

No persistence. Every request is computed from the same in-memory `[]NavItemSpec` the registry populated under `ServiceNavItems` at boot.

## What it owns

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `module.go` | Module registration, nav-items + config-service lookup, handler wire-up |
| `routes.go` | Huma route registration (one endpoint) |
| `handlers/navigation_handler.go` | Extracts the system role from the request context and calls the service |
| `services/navigation_service.go` | Navigation service interface |
| `services/dynamic_navigation.go` | Role + enabled-module filtering implementation |
| `models/navigation.go` | `NavigationResponse` DTO returned to the frontend |

## MongoDB collections

None. This module is stateless.

## Dependencies

- **Modules**: none declared.
- **Required services**: none.
- **Optional services** (read at `Init`):
  - `ServiceNavItems` — `[]module.NavItemSpec` populated by the registry before any module's `Init` runs (`shared/module/registry.go:153`). Empty slice if no modules declared nav items.
  - `ServiceConfigService` — `*ModuleConfigService`, used as a `middleware.ModuleEnabledChecker` to skip items from disabled modules at request time.
- **Provides**: none (no module consumes navigation; the frontend talks to it directly).
- **Permissions contributed**: none.

## Lifecycle

`Init` (`module.go:22-38`) reads `ServiceNavItems` and `ServiceConfigService` from the registry, builds a `DynamicNavigationService`, and wraps it in a handler. `Start`, `Stop`, and `HealthCheck` are no-ops inherited from `BaseModule`.

There is no seeding. The nav-items list is assembled by the registry in `InitAll` (`shared/module/registry.go:146-153`) which walks every registered module's `NavItems()` method, stamps each item with the owning module name, and stores the aggregated slice under `ServiceNavItems` before any module gets its `Init` call — which is why navigation (which reads that key during its own init) always sees the full set.

## HTTP endpoints

| Method | Path | Gate | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/navigation` | Bearer token (protected router) | Return the role-filtered menu tree for the current user |

Registered in `routes.go::RegisterRoutes`. The route is mounted on the protected router in `module.go:40-43`, so it requires a valid access token but no specific permission.

## Service contract

None. Navigation does not expose anything in `shared/iface` — no other backend module consumes it.

## Key invariants

- **Three filters run per request**, in order, in `services/dynamic_navigation.go::convert`:
  1. **Module enabled.** If `ServiceConfigService` was present at init, items whose owning module is disabled (`module_configs.enabled == false`) are skipped. The check is per-request, cached through the config service's Redis layer — toggling a module in `/admin/modules` takes effect on the next nav fetch without a restart.
  2. **Tier vs tenant kind.** Items with `Tier="internal"` are hidden from callers acting in an external tenant; `Tier="external"` items are hidden from internal callers; empty `Tier` is visible to both. Tenant kind is read from `middleware.TenantKindFromContext(ctx)` (populated by the auth middleware from the JWT's resolved acting-tenant).
  3. **MinRole.** Items are included when the caller's system role is at or above `MinRole` in the hierarchy `super_admin > administrator > developer > manager > operator > guest`. Empty `MinRole` = no restriction. The hierarchy matches `ROLE_HIERARCHY` on the frontend.
- **Parent items with no path collapse when every child is filtered out.** A parent acts as a menu group if it has `Children` and no `Path`; if all children are hidden, the parent vanishes too.
- **Dual response shape.** `NavigationResponse` emits **both** the legacy `groups []RouteGroup` (flat `section → items`, v1) and the new `realms []NavRealm` (nested `realm → section → items`, v2). Realms use canonical keys `personal | platform | business | shared` with canonical labels `My workspace | Companies | Clients | Tools`. The key `platform` stays fixed (internal identifier); the label is free to evolve. Realms are emitted in that fixed order; unknown realm keys append in discovery order. The dual shape exists so the frontend can migrate to v2 without a synchronized deploy.
- **`TenantKind` is surfaced in the response.** `NavigationResponse.TenantKind` echoes the filter context so the frontend can cache per-tier menus without re-reading the JWT. Cache key includes the tenant kind: `nav:<role>:<kind>` (falls back to `nav:<role>` when no tenant is resolved).
- **Stateless.** No DB writes, no background jobs. All state is the in-memory slice built at boot.
- **Module-name stamping.** The registry sets `ModuleName` on every `NavItemSpec` and recursively on every child item before handing them to navigation. This is what the enabled-module filter keys off.

## What this module does NOT do

- Persist user-specific preferences (favorites, collapsed groups, reordering) — not implemented
- Evaluate per-org fine-grained permissions (e.g., "only show Invoices if the user has `billing.invoice.read` in this org"). The tier filter is tenant-kind-scoped, not per-org-binding-scoped — per-org filtering waits on the authz permission-domain-tag refactor.
- Return a route map or permission gates to the frontend — it only returns human-readable menu entries; the frontend's React Router still has to have the route registered
- Hide a menu item because its *target* module is failing its health check — only explicit disabled state is honored

## Rules

- **Never hardcode menu entries in this module.** Every item must come from some other module's `NavItems()`. If you find yourself adding items in `navigation_service.go`, the entry belongs in the owning module instead.
- **Never return the raw `NavItemSpec`** — wrap in `NavigationResponse` (`models/navigation.go`). The wrapper is the frontend contract; the spec is an internal detail.
- **Never fall back to the guest tier silently** for a user with a non-empty token but unresolvable role. Log it — it means the system-role field is corrupt or a rename migration was missed.
- **Prefer `Realm` + `Section` over the legacy `Group` field** in new modules. The aggregator maps items into the v2 shape by realm key first, section label second; `Group` is kept only so pre-migration modules still render.
- **When the authz permission-domain-tag refactor lands**, replace the tenant-kind+role filter with `authz.GetEffectivePermissions` and filter items by a `RequiredPermission` field on `NavItemSpec`.

## Known limitation

Filtering by tenant kind + global system role still can't express per-org scope (e.g., "show `Billing` in org A but not org B for the same user"). The underlying `authz` module already has per-org effective permissions; the hook-up is future work tied to the permission-domain-tag refactor. Until then, the frontend compensates by hiding a per-org menu section when `authz.GetEffectivePermissions` returns an empty set for that org — but the returned tree still contains every item the role+tier allows.
